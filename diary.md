Things to do:
    Status must be enum
    Add some endpoints for updating things
    Authorization

But for now I'll focus on displaying things on the screen
Have been enjoying making components, gonna be a pain when I plug the states tho
Have to fix colors scheme too

This react router thing is a bit hard and shady, but in the end I got it. Just noticed I should add some sort of load page, not sure I'm gonna do it

I guess a custom hooks would really fit for an auth flow.I'll go with the bad fast option.
Not sure if it's that bad my main reasoning is managing the token on app because layout is supposed to be about the laytout
I could pass the whole onclick function as a prop too, seems like an even better option to hooks

Modals and stuff, will I even have time to wire eveything together?
