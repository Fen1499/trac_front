Things to do:
    Status must be enum
    Add some endpoints for updating things
    Authorization

But for now I'll focus on displaying things on the screen
Have been enjoying making components, gonna be a pain when I plug the states tho
Have to fix colors scheme too

This react router thing is a bit hard and shady, but in the end I got it.
